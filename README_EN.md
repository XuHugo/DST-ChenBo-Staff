# Chenbo Almighty King Staff

This mod adds a magical staff that allows you to summon pigmen as your loyal followers!

- Craft the Chenbo Almighty King Staff in the Tools tab with simple materials.
- Use the staff to summon pigmen who will follow and protect you.
- Each player can have up to 6 summoned pigmen at the same time.
- If a pigman dies, you can summon a new one to replace it.
- The staff supports custom inventory icons, and can also use in-game art.
- Summoned pigmen will periodically say custom colored lines (such as "Just this? Pig army!"), and will not say any vanilla AI lines.
- The lines and their colors can be customized and extended in the mod code.
- Summoned pigmen have different types:
    - 50% chance to be a normal pigman (no special equipment or stats).
    - 30% chance to be a custom pigman with a straw hat and spear (stronger stats).
    - 20% chance to be a custom pigman with a miner hat (always glowing, stronger stats, will follow you even at night).

Build your own piggy army and make survival much easier!
